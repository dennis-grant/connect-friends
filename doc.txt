Overview
----------

ConnectFriends is a simple experimental social app. It covers about 15 use cases (user stories).
These include:
	1. show all users
	2. show favorite posts
	3. submit post
	4. follow user
	5. show users I am following
	etc

The goal of ConnectFriends is to practice javascript programming skills:
	1. Explore Javascript application design
	2. Experiment with a few generic controls which can be used in up coming projects.

A few of the main application design ideas I experimented with are:
	1. Model View Controller design pattern
	2. Limited scope generic controls
	3. Covering every aspect of interface using Controls


MVC
-----

The role of the model is to captured all the data being processed by the client, cached from the server.

The controller acts as a mediator between the server and the model. All communications with the server takes
place through the controller and all changes to the model are only done by the controller.

The view serves to display the current state of the model and to capture user interactions.

To integrate the above parts an application object is used. The application object initializes the model,
view and controller; listens to all events triggered in the view, making the required calls to the controller;
and refreshes the view when required.

FAQ

Q. How is the main display panel updated
A. The main display panel uses a list-control. Any change to the model
   of the list-control automatically causes the view to be updated.


Benefits
----------

1. Independent controls which can be developed, tested and debugged by themselves.

2. A lot more flexibility in changing the view without affecting the rest of the application

3. A well known/proven design pattern.

4. Much faster development with each part having a simplified clearly defined role.
